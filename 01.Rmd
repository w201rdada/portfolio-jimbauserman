## Online ad copy is a major driver of clickthrough rates (CTR), but is hard to evaluate quantitatively 

The specific text displayed in an online advertisement can be crucial to driving traffic to an advertiser's site. However, the performance of specific ads (evaluated in terms of CTR) is driven by a wide variety of factors beyond the actual ad text, including the users that are seeing the ad, the ad's compatibility with the user's search query, and the relative strength of competing ads or organic content on the search engine result page (SERP). Moreover, since ad copy is written in natural language, there are a huge variety of options to choose from and no well-defined cost function to optimize. As a result, it is extremely difficult to identify which words and phrases are the best at getting users to click on an ad.

## The effectiveness of specific ad copy can be assessed through experiments

In order to disentangle the effectiveness of specific ad copy from other confounding factors, we can conduct a facsimile of a randomized control trial. Online Ad Text Shuffler (OATS) would taking existing ad copy and allocate them randomly between ad groups. For example, a shoe company might be running ads that could be categorized into groups like "Buy The Hottest Styles", "Find The Perfect Shoe For You", or "Check Out Our Sales!". OATS would select a sample of ad-keyword combinations and randomly shuffle ads between those keywords. Data on CTRs would be collected and evaluated by an appropriate model to determine which ads were most effective after controlling for the keywords those ads appeared on. This process could be repeated any number of times to improve the accuracy of the model. Once the best performing ads have been identified with a sufficient degree of confidence, they could be propagated to all keywords to maximize CTRs across an entire account.

As an extension of this process, each segment of the ads could be mixed and matched for more accurate evaluation. While examples of the headline ad text were given above, search ads actually feature multiple discreet text chunks. For instance, the headlines above would be supplemented with additional text such as "Get Your New Look Today!" or "Very Stylish, Very Comfortable". A full implementation of OATS would also shuffle these sub-parts of the ads around to identify which additional text works best overall or best complements each headline.

In addition, a more advanced version of OATS could use natural language processing (NLP) to assign additional features to ads such as urgency, personalization, or use of the imperative. This would abstract from the specific ad copy to determine which generic features are most predictive of high CTRs. Advertiser's could then generate new, optimized ad copy, rather than just identifying the best practices among existing ads.


## Identifying and propagating the best ad copy will improve CTR

Even small improvements in CTR can have a large impact on an advertiser's business. Not only does a higher CTR directly contribute to more visitors to a site, but search engines also view higher CTRs as a signal that an ad is more relevant and give it a higher "quality score", which allows an advertiser to win more auctions at the same bid level. OATS would allow a search advertiser to identify which parts of their current ads are most effective and propagate these best practices across their account, ultimately generating more traffic at a lower cost per click.
