## Online ad copy is a major driver of clickthrough rates (CTR), but is hard to evaluate quantitatively 

The specific text displayed in an online advertisement can be crucial to driving traffic to an advertiser's site. However, the performance of specific ads (evaluated in terms of CTR) is driven by a wide variety of factors beyond the actual ad text, including the kinds of users that are seeing the ad, the ad's compatibility with the user's search query, and the relative strength of competing ads or organic content on the search engine result page (SERP). Moreover, since ad copy is written in natural language, there are a huge variety of options to choose from and no well-defined cost function to optimize. As a result, it is extremely difficult to identify which words and phrases are the best at getting users to click on an ad.

## The effectiveness of specific ad copy can be assessed through experiments

In order to disentangle the effectivess of specific ad copy from other confoudinfg factors, we can conduct a fascimile of a randomized control trials. Online Ad Text Shuffler (OATS) would taking existing ad copy, consolidate it into a limited number of templates, and allocate those templates randomly between ad groups.

[ZZ Then we do some statistics stuff to find out the effectiveness of the ad text. Then we consider breaking down the problem further to evaluate each chunk of an ad. Also, we have to worry about burn-in costs. Extremely ambitious implementation would involve actual NLP, but MVP would not at all]

## Identifying and propagating the best ad copy will improve CTR

Even small improvements in CTR can have a large impact on an advertiser's business. Not only does a higher CTR directly contribute to more visitors to a site, but search engines also view higher CTRs as a signal that an ad is more relevant and give it a higher "quality score", which allows an advertiser to win more auctions at the same level of bid.
