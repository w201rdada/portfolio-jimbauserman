Hello and welcome to my portfolio from Research Design and Applications for Data Analysis (RDADA) during the Spring 2018 term of the MIDS program at Berkeley. There's not much here yet, but stay tuned.


### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

I propose using natural language processing and careful modeling to optimize ad copy in search advertising. This will enable advertisers to effectively test and tune their ads while avoiding pitfalls associated with the online advertising context.

### Abstract of my second cool idea {-}

I propose using job listings and other data to estimate the returns from various kinds of professional training and qualifications in order to recommend these training options to job seekers.
