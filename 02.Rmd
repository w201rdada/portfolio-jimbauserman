## Specialization creates a mismatch between jobs and qualified candidates

Despite low levels of overall unemployment, the US economy faces skills gap in many industries such as healthcare, IT, and manufacturing. This leads to both unfilled vacancies and workers without jobs. Moreover, according to the Third Way Center, "[m]ost of these occupations do not necessarily require four-year college degrees, but do require specialized training and some sort of credential" [@stephens_mind_2017]. This means that the skills gap could be bridged if job seekers could acquire these relatively low-cost credentials. However, workers frequently consider education and employment as two related but separate problems, potentially missing out on training opportunities that could significantly advance their careers. 

## Returns to gaining specific qualifications can be predicted 

Given access to a database of job listings and their requirements, the skill gap for each type of qualification can be estimated. This would allow us to identify which qualifications are most likely to get job seekers' jobs. If we additionally know the salaries of most of those jobs, we can estimate which qualifications earn workers the most money.

With a database of job seekers and their characteristics, including education and job history, we can recommend qualifications that have the potential to give job seekers the largest return. These would be qualifications that have the highest skill gap in that job seeker's area. These would be the qualifications with the most local job listings for which the job seekers is qualfied _except_ for lack of that qualification, weighted by the jobs' salaries.

## Job seekers can better understand their choices with more information

By integrating the process of retraining and job seeking, workers could make better decisions about the path of their career. They could more easily view their available options, and think about retraining even when they had not previously been thinking they might want a new job.
