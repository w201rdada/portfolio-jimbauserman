## Playlists are playlist; mixes are mixes

Despite rapid advancements in recommendation algorithms for music listeners, the results are ultimately just collections of songs. Mixes, generated by DJs blending together songs on the fly, can be a much more compelling way to experience music, but cannot currently be generated algorithmically.

## Mixes can be generated on the fly for any occasion

By using existing DJ mixes along with the audio from the songs being mixed, an algorithm can be trained to perform the same blending done by professional DJs on an arbitrary list of songs. Such an algorithm would likely piggy-back on existing algorithms for, e.g., beat matching, key identification, etc., and could be layered on top of a full-fledged recommendation algorithm.

## Users can access custom-blended infinite mixes for any mood

Given a list of songs, users can generate mixes for a variety of situations, whether it's an exercise mix that maintains a constant tempo, a party mix that cuts out all of the "boring" parts, or just an ambient mix that provides a seamless background while thinking deep thoughts.
